This code does not ship with the product.  It is only used in development.

When we were preparing to upgrade to PHP 5.3, my testing found that simpletest somehow caused PHP to code dump in the garbage collector.  I had no real desire to find that bug and submit it to PHP, so I went looking for an updated version of simpletest.  Simpltest.org has released nothing since 2008.  However, I found that the simpletest developers have given a development dump to the guys who do QCubed.  The latter have been including the dump in their releases.  So I downloaded http://qcu.be/files/releases/qcubed-2.0.0.zip and checked in the simpletest from there as simpletest1.1beta.
