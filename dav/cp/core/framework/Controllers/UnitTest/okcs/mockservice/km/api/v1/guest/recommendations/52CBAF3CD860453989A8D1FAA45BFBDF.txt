As mentioned in Starting Up, using the directory structure to sort these objects into sensible categories can be a big help. Instead of starting the R session in a particular directory, you may wish to keep a directory of R scripts and allow these to change the working directory to suit whatever task they perform.\nFirst, choose your directory. This will be the place where all of your R scripts will be stored. You can either change to this directory before starting R or use the method described in Starting Up. Let's examine the beginning and end of a typical script written for this purpose:\n\n# store the current directory\ninitial.dir&lt;-getwd()\n# change to the new directory\nsetwd(\"/home/jim/psych/risk/adol\")\n# load the necessary libraries\nlibrary(nlme)\n# set the output file\nsink(\"adolrisk03.out\")\n# load the dataset\n...\n# close the output file\nsink()\n# unload the libraries\ndetach(\"package:nlme\")\n# change back to the original directory\nsetwd(initial.dir)\nFirst notice that the script stores the initial directory and changes to the directory where the data is, and where output will be generated. The libraries necessary for the analysis are then loaded. Finally, the output of the script is directed to a text file, producing a record of the analysis. Then comes the action. After the analysis has been completed, the output file is closed, the libraries are unloaded, and the directory is changed back to where the scripts reside. At this point, you may want to start another script or shut down R.","dateAdded":"2016-04-18T03:43:09-0600","dateModified":"2016-04-18T03:43:09-0600","requestedByUserId":"012095047d248c01541a05214f007e48","requestedByUserName":"testcp 100","status":"NEW","title":"RE: Test"}
