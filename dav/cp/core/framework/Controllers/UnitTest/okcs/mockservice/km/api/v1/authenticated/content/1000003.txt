All that is required is knowledge of web application development skills (HTML, CSS and JavaScript).</span></span> \n<br /> &nbsp; \n<br /> \n<span style=\"font-family:helvetica neue;\"><span style=\"font-size:8.0pt;\">The widget library consists of individual components that perform a particular function and expose interactions with each other to provide a high degree of flexibility and customizability. Widgets can be used to quickly build pages with functions such as Search, Result, Facets, Category, and Channel. Each Widget can be easily instantiated and configured, and they can also be set up to interact with each other (i.e. Search + Result + Facets).&nbsp; Here is a full list of widgets:</span></span> \n<br /> &nbsp; \n<br /> \n<strong><span style=\"font-family:helvetica neue;\"><span style=\"font-size:8.0pt;\">AnswerView</span></span></strong> \n<br /> \n<span style=\"font-family:helvetica neue;\"><span style=\"font-size:8.0pt;\">Displays a document's details.&nbsp; A single instance can be shared between multiple widgets.&nbsp; It can be configured with AnswerList and Result widgets.</span></span> \n<br /> &nbsp; \n<br /> \n<strong><span style=\"font-family:helvetica neue;\"><span style=\"font-size:8.0pt;\">AnswerList</span></span></strong> \n<br /> \n<span style=\"font-family:helvetica neue;\"><span style=\"font-size:8.0pt;\">Depending on the configured type, this will display a list of 'recent', 'popular', or 'common' documents.&nbsp; Document details will be displayed in the specified AnswerView.&nbsp; If no AnswerView widget is specified, it will create its own instance.</span></span> \n<br /> &nbsp; \n<br /> \n<strong><span style=\"font-family:helvetica neue;\"><span style=\"font-size:8.0pt;\">Search</span></span></strong> \n<br /> \n<span style=\"font-family:helvetica neue;\"><span style=\"font-size:8.0pt;\">Provides the search form along with optional pre-search filters such as languages and document types.&nbsp; Result and Facets widgets require a Search widget instance.&nbsp; Can be configured in a CaseDeflection widget, and the same instance of Search widget can be used to be styled differently.</span></span>]]></DESCRIPTION><FILE_ATTACHMENT SIZE=\"377763\"><![CDATA[Integrating Oracle Knowledge with Customer Portal.docx]]></FILE_ATTACHMENT></SOLUTIONS>","resourcePath":"http://slc01fjo.us.oracle.com:8228/fas/resources/okcs__ok152b1__t2/content/draft/08202021a090884014b553ed630007fe8/08202021a090884014b553ed630007fed/"}
