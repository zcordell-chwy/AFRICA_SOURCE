# To use this, run the script and redirect the output to CoreCodeIgniter.php.
# For example: 
#
#    ./createCoreCodeIgniter.sh > CoreCodeIgniter.php
#
# or to create a CoreCodeIgniter.php which just requires its constituent parts, which is
# useful hile you're making changes to one of those files, add the -d switch.  For example:
#
#    ./createCoreCodeIgniter.sh -d > CoreCodeIgniter.php
#


# Remember that any file you add to this list will have have its first and last lines removed.
